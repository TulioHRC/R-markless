## Introduction

This report was generated using **R Markdown**. The goal is to present a simple analysis of the `cars` dataset included with R and to demonstrate creating visualizations using Python.

## Analysis of the `cars` Dataset

Below are the first few rows of the `cars` dataset:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Displaying the first few rows of the cars dataset (generic from R)
head(cars)
```

## Python Data Science

You can use whatever language you want to present here.

```{python echo=TRUE}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = 1 + np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
plt.plot(t, s)
plt.xlabel('time (s)')
plt.ylabel('voltage (mV)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.savefig("test.png")
plt.show()
```
